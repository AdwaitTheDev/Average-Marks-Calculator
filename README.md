# Average-Marks-Calculator

Hi

In this small project, you just have to give the marks secured in 5 subjects (In my case, it's Maths, Science, SST, English and French)
After giving in your inputs, the program finds the total marks secured by adding all the 5 subjects.
Finally, to find the average marks secured, the program divides the total marks secured by the number of subjects listed.

PS: This was done in our school and to store this program in a safe location, I uploaded my code here!
